You can write the name you want, I would recommend something like "SummerTalksApp" or "AndroidKotlinApp"

The company domain would be your webpage or your company's webpage. As you can see in the package name,
Android Studio automatically reverts the order of your company domain, 
this allows the appstore to have a unique identifier for yor app.

Be sure to check the "Incluce Kotlin support" checkbox

## Target Android Devices

The only devices that we are interested in are phones. Android Studio will then select API 19 (Kit Kat) by default, 
if you want to know how many phones you can potentially reach with your app, you can click "Help me choose."

You'll se the API distribution in all Android phones and the OS characteristics.

We'll stick with API 19.

## Adding an activity

For now, we'll say that an activity is a single screen of your app. You'll be given many templates of an activity to choose from.
Chose empty activity.

You can name this activity "MainActivity" as it is by default. As you can see the layout file is generated for us.

Click finish and we are ready to start!
