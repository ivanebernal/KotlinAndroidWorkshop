Are you willing to take on a more advance challenge?

Here are some things you might want to do to your app!

## Challenges

* Add a new "Contact Information" activity and open it when the user clicks a contact 
(Protip: read about Parcelables and how to add a Parcelable implementation to a class) 
(Protip2: Intent.putExtra(), Intent.getExtra)
* Add different photos tho each contact
* Add a new contact in the app (this might be very advanced)
* Make an intent to open google maps to search the contact's address ([here](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android-api/intents))
* Delete a contact

I hope you learned a lot with this workshop, but most importantly, I hope that you want to learn more!
