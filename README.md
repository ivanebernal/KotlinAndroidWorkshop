# KotlinAndroidWorkshop
App for the Nearsoft Summer Talks Workshop: "Introduction to Android Development with Kotlin"

## How we will be working

In this repo you'll find a folder called "codelabs", here you'll find instructions (codelabs) for each excercise we will do. 
Additionally I'll be doing the same excercises on screen.

If you get lost you can use the command `git checkout [commit]` to go to an advanced version of the project. 
You'll find the [commit] number at the beginning of each codelab.

If you have any questions, ask me any time!
